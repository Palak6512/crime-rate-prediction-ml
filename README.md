# Crime Rate Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project analyzes and predicts crime rates in India using machine learning techniques.  
It performs data preprocessing, visualization, feature reduction using PCA, and applies multiple regression models to identify the **best-performing algorithm for crime prediction**.

---

 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze crime patterns across Indian States/UTs  
- Visualize crime distribution and trends  
- Reduce dimensionality using PCA  
- Compare multiple ML regression models  
- Predict Total IPC Crimes with best accuracy  

---

📂 Dataset Used
- **newtrial - Sheet 1 - 01_District_wise_crim 2.csv**
- Contains crime statistics across:
  - 35+ States/UTs  
  - 16+ crime categories  
  - Years 2001–2012  

---

🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned column names  
- Removed non-required attributes  
- Filtered only major crime categories  
- Handled missing/invalid entries  
- Performed **feature scaling** before PCA
